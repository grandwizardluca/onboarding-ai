# CLAUDE CODE STARTER PROMPT
# Copy everything between the dashes and paste it into your Claude Code terminal

I need you to read four files before we do anything else:
- CLAUDE.md
- PRD.md
- architecture.md
- buildplan.md

Read all four carefully — not a skim. Study them to the point where you can deeply discuss any part of them. Do not write any code until I tell you to.

When you are done reading, tell me:
1. A 5-bullet summary of what Socratic.sg is and what we are building
2. Every clarifying question you have before we start Phase 0

I will answer your questions. Then we begin Phase 0 only.

Rules while we work:
- Follow buildplan.md phase by phase. Do not jump ahead.
- After each phase, stop and wait for my confirmation before proceeding.
- After each phase, update buildplan.md (check off completed items) and update architecture.md if anything changed.
- Explain every action in plain English after you do it.
- Simple code only. No clever abstractions.
- If you are about to change something that touches more than one file or could break something, stop and explain first.

Stack: Next.js 14 App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Supabase, Anthropic API (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929), OpenAI embeddings (text-embedding-3-small), deploy to Vercel.

Let's go. Read the files first.
